# LeaxOS

LeaxOS is an independent, Unix-like hobby operating system developed entirely from scratch without relying on Linux or any existing kernel base. As a fully open-source project, LeaxOS provides a modern, efficient, and secure computing environment while maintaining strict adherence to Unix standards and conventions.

## Project Overview

LeaxOS represents a ground-up approach to operating system development, combining traditional Unix philosophy with contemporary system design principles. The architecture emphasizes clean code structure, modularity, and performance optimization, making it suitable for both research and production environments.

**Core Characteristics:**
- Independent kernel architecture built without Linux, BSD, or other existing foundations
- Full POSIX compliance and Unix compatibility
- Microkernel-based design with hybrid performance optimizations
- Memory-safe implementation with modern security features
- Modular component structure enabling extensive customization
- Cross-platform compatibility and efficient resource utilization

## Technical Architecture

LeaxOS implements a hybrid kernel design that combines microkernel modularity with monolithic kernel performance. The system architecture includes comprehensive memory management, sophisticated process scheduling, robust inter-process communication, and a layered file system abstraction that supports multiple file system types.

The project maintains strict code quality standards with comprehensive testing coverage, continuous integration workflows, and detailed technical documentation. Security is integrated at the architectural level with capability-based access control, memory protection mechanisms, and sandboxed execution environments.
